I have got several Gihub repos for learning:

- [using cli, linux and WSL](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/notes-linux-cli)
- [using pandoc as citation manager](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/notes-pandoc)
- [general programming tips and book references](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/learn)
- [superhero](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/superhero) to teach IT to business analysts
- visualisation techniques
- and probably others, listed in [lighttable](https://github.com/epogrebnyak/lighttable)

There are way too many repos. It would be nice to publish them under one roof and single contents.
