Currently, in Denmark i have a research appointment at a university. But i am looking into creating an applied research project that could be found by the DK Industry Foundation.  Or we could approach a friend of mine who is CTO at Grundfos... digitalization or Russian market development?

Several thoughts on digitalization: 

- Digitalization in the Russian market is rather chaotic, often buzzwords seem to overtake substance. 
- From managment perspective there are a lot of slogans one can pick up, get backing from  the vendors (IBM, SAP, etc) and spend budgets. Similar story in government IT - I made a review of API-based services which are paid in Russia  and free in other countries - does not look good in light of money being spent on "Цифровая экономика" and "Электронная Россия". Also regulations that keep paper and burocrats in charge. 

- From the investor perspective I think there is a need for independent metrics/toolkits to access technologic readiness and possible paths for further IT adoption (=digitalisation), possibly by differentiated by industry (ERP/non-ERP, vendor solutions vs in-house devlopment, standartisation of business processes vs customisation of software, consumer-centered improvements vs internal productivity). Generally, I think companies are very bad at changing old products, but slightly better in working on new ones. I guess this can be summarised under "better IT-strategy". I also like the idea that digitalization is a strategy-first, not IT-led process (implies different set of competences).
  

- I think missing links globally (potentially in Denmark) are consumer empowerment (privacy issues and more broadly - every company wants consumer to install own app and cross-sell, consumer data being transfered, less bargaining power, less consumer protection) and digital corporate finance (most initiatives in Industry 4.0 rely on traditional finance with quarterly reporting, which is expensive from investors side, alternative platform-based credit markets will require more, near real-time disclosure, see Schuldschein private credit notes market in Germany). 
  
Also can play on gaps in other Industry 4.0 (real cost/benefits balance of digitalization, vendor-led initiative, proprietary standards lock-in).

Companies view digitalization  as a next round of 
IT spending with a bit of change of narrrative (we had older systems, now they are newer and better, following some kind of 'best practice'). True changes, good for different stakehodlers would occur in:

1. End user benefits:
- empowering user (consumer choice, demand side management in utilities, privacy beyond GDPR, exposing APIs like PSD2, quicker dispute resolution)
- long-term cost saving for the user (eg this is a goal in industrial policy in healthcare in France), lower lifecycle costs / total costs of ownership

2. Shareholder/investor benefits:
- transparency and accountability in business and government (segment and finer-grain reporting, real-time costing, pay-as-you use insurance, automated internal audits)
- better representation of investment projects to investors, with easier monitoring 
and benchmarking
- pressures for specialisation and outsourcing non-core buinesses, choosing proper depth of outsourcsing (new configurations of business functions, boundaries of a firm, platforms)

3. Society as a whole:
- gains from wider adoption of new standards (electronic signiture, dispute resolution,   paperless document exchange), lowering transaction costs
- matching public spending and effects (outputs, outcomes, impact frameworks)
- free machine-readable access to significant information (eg court decisions)

Barriers:
- no risk-taking, safer do nothing, never a first-mover
- command-and-control culture, no space for innovation 
- trying to extract gains from mimicking others
- no vision, no change until too late 
- (low-yeild) incremental vs (risky) break-through changes
- too many priorities 
- short time-spans of planning 
- hypes, buzzwords, window-dressing
- corruption, cost overruns, kickbacks, uninterested stackeholders
